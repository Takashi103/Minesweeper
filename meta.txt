This is just a list of stuff that we can work out about the languages and stuff. Nothing specific to the project.
Stuff I'm not sure of is '+' and stuff I haven't tested is '*'

On javascript:

On the syntax: Mostly like java.

Lines end in semicolons.

Arrays and variables
You make a variable by saying "var (varname);" or "var lenny = 12;". Any variable can point to anything, including a number, a string, another variable, an object, a funciton, or an array. You declare an array as [], and you can make an array with twelve cells by saying [3 * 4]. An array variable gets an array like "var bill = [12, 14, "oranges", function emptyFunction() {}];" You can add elements to an array by doing stuff like "meats[14] = "unicorn";" even if meats[14] hasn't been made yet.

Methods/Functions
You use methods (they call them "functions") by putting parentheses around the arguments ("dankMemes(dankness, meme[0] + meme[4]);"). Methods can wrap around each other ("dankMemes(getDankness(), getMemes(0, 4));" Methods are made like "

function damn(counter) {
	for(i = 0; i < counter; i++)
		console.log("dammit!");
}

" They are not run unless they are explicitly called from elsewhere. So if you make a method in the middle of the rest of your code, it won't get executed just because it's in line with the rest.

Automatic Type Conversion: weird. You can use pretty much any operator with any variable, and they'll all work. Rules :

Booleans:
Anything that's a zero or contains no data becomes false.
Anything that's not zero or contains data* (like the string "hello!") becomes true.

Strings:
Adding strings to other strings combines them.
Adding numbers will change the number into a string, and attach it to the other string.
Other number operations try to convert the string into a number. If the string isn't made of digits, it becomes Nan (not a number, which is different from null). If it's made of digits, it becomes a number and the operation continues.

Numbers:
Boolean true becomes 1, false becomes 0.
See strings for their rules.

Examples:
8 * null
0
"5" - 1
4
"5" + 1
51
"five" * 2
NaN
false == 0
true
